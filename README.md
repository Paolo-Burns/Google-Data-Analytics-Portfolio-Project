# Google-Data-Analytics-Portfolio-Project

## Introduction

#### For this project, I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. I will be performing tasks that help the company answer business questions using the data provided.

## Background

#### Cyclistic is a bike-share program  with over 5,824 geotracked bicycles that are part of a large network of 692 stations across chicago. Users are able to pick up a bike from any station and then return it to any other station. Cyclystic's marketing strategy relies on general awareness and appealing to broad consumers segments. Cyclistic achieved this by offering various pricing plans, such as single-ride passes, full-day passes, or annual memberships. 

Cyclistic has recently taken note that annual members are much more profitable than casual users who purchase single ride or full day passes. Moreno, the director of marketing, believes that maximizing the number of annual members is the key to future growth.
